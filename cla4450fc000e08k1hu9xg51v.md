# Types of tags in HTML

According to names Basically there are two types of tags in HTML. First one is semantic tags which are easily understandable by their names itself (e.g.- table, form) Second one is non-semantic tags whose meanings are not easily understandable by their names (e.g.- div, span). 

According to the closing type tags may be self closing or not self closing tags. The self closing tags include `<br>, <b>, <i>` etc. The non self closing tags includes `<p>` in which we have to write `</p>` for closing of the tag.

Some tags used in HTML are as follows-

`<!DOCTYPE>` It defines the type of the document which we have to define. It can contain HTML or XHTML.

`<html>` All the elements and codes of the program is written inside the html tag except the doctype tag.

`<head>` It contains all the metadata tags and other tags which contains all the necessary information about the program. It also includes links to various features like style tags.

`<title>` It contains the title of the page we are making.

`<body>` It contains the main working part of the html file which we are showing on the webpage. It also contains script or link to the script of the file which is helpful in the working of the webpage.

`<h1> to <h6>` It contains six different types of tags where "h" stands for heading. We can provide six types of heading tags depending on the preference in the webpage.

`<p>` This tag stands for paragraph tag. It can have content which includes various sentences. 

`<pre>` This tag stands for preformatted tags which is similar to the p tag mentioned above. The basic difference is that the content written inside this tag shows in the similar format as written(It preserves all the line breaks and spaces exactly same). But if we write same content in the p tag the content shows in a very normal manner avoiding all the line breaks and extra spaces.

`<br>` The br tag is used to insert a single line break within the content.

`<hr>` It is used to make a horizontal ruler to separate contents.

`<!--...-->` It is used to make any content as a comment in the HTML file which we don't have to take as a code in the program. This tag starts with "<!-- " then it contains all the content of the comment and closed by "-->" for example <!-- This is a comment -->

`<img>`  It is used to insert any image that we want to insert in our webpage.

`<ul>`  It is used to define any unordered type of list in HTML.

`<ol>`  It is used to define an ordered type of list which can have order in 1,2,3 or a,b,c and many more.

`<li>`  It is used to define list item in any ordered list or unordered list.

HTML also contains more tags for formatting, forms and inputs, audio/video, images, links, list, tables, styles etc.
