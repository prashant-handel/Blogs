# This years journey #Dev Retro 2022

## Short Introduction

I am a B.Tech graduate from **<mark>Mechanical Engineering</mark>** branch. I passed out of Higher Secondary School in 2018 and decided to do mechanical engineering. After passing out of school I wanted to do engineering and crack GATE examination and then work as a mechanical engineer in a top company.

But <mark>life wants me to take on to another track</mark> that I have never thought of. When I was in the third semester Covid-19 came to India and my college closed. With the closing of college my dream to crack GATE and work in a recognized company also threw away.

After the first lockdown, I started to work in a company where I worked as a typist and developed good typing skills. It's been too late since my college starts after approximately 2 years. I was in the seventh semester at that time. I lose hope of cracking GATE examination now because I have not studied in college due to Covid.

## How I got familiar with coding?

I belong to a middle-class family. I have to manage to get a good job to get aside from the flow of my family. I decided to do something that could give me the living that I dreamt to live.

Life is full of doubts. At the start of this year (2022) when I was in the seventh semester <mark>I was in doubt to choose whether to prepare for a government job or start coding and build my career in it</mark>. I decided to do coding and make my career in coding. I don't know anything about coding since Feb 2022. At the suggestion of my friend, I joined a coaching and learned programming in C/C++.

## The turning point toward web development

After learning the above languages, I got much more familiar with coding. Now I don't know what to do next, then comes a turning point in my coding journey. I got to know about a person whom my friend knows. I went to that man and he became my mentor who told me about, what to do, how to start, what not to do etc. He is @[Swapnil M Mane](@swapnilmmane) whom I thank from the depth of my heart. He guided me to do HTML CSS and JavaScript and also start blogging on this platform #hashnode. The journey of learning JavaScript is going on.

## My Hashnode journey

I have no idea how to write a blog and where to write. Then my mentor @[Swapnil M Mane](@swapnilmmane) told me to join hashnode and write blogs consistently on it. <mark>It doesn't matter what to write, how to write, how your English is etc. The thing that matters most is to get started.</mark> Hence, without thinking more I started to write my first blog on Hashnode. [(My first blog).](https://prashanthandel.hashnode.dev/html-basic-concepts)

When I was not familiar with blog writing I think its boring. But after writing a few blogs on Hashnode I got to know about writing blogs is not only for sharing out thoughts and learning with others. <mark>The importance of blog writing is that it revises what we have learned and makes us more acquainted.</mark>

## Conclusion

When I look back on 2022 I saw my journey of coding that started this year only. A person who doesn't know a little bit about coding to a person who eagerly wants to learn to code. This is only started we have to go beyond with it in the coming years. <mark>The learning from this blog is that you have to take the first step only. The first step is the most difficult but also the most important.</mark> At last, I wish you all a very happy year ahead and hope you will always take the first step in your life without hesitation.
