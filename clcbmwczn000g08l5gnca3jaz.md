    ## Adding React Developer Tools
    
    If you are using Chrome browser, then it is better to install a chrome extension 'React Developer Tools'.
    
    Click on the link '[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)' and click on Add to Chrome button to add the extension.

    The React Developer Tools help get the props and states of our components in an organized way. We can inspect and edit its current props and state in the console of the browser which we will learn afterward.
    
    ## Some useful extensions of VS Code
